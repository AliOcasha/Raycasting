# 2D Raycasting
Implementing a selfwritten __basic 2D Raycasting Algorithm__.  
First tried to implement it in *C# and Unity* but this resulted in pure Chaos for me.  
It needed to be implemented through different components using Prefabs and Objects, which made things difficult for me.  

So I abonded Unity and C# for this Project and switched to __Python using pygame__ to draw lines. Now everyhting is far more simple and usable.
