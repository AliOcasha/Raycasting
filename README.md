# Raycasting
Implementing a own __basic 2D Raycasting Algorithm__.  
First tried to implement it in *C# and Unity* but this resulted in pure Chaos, as Unity was not suited to be used just to Draw Lines.  
It needed to be implemented through different components using Prefabs and Objects, which made things difficult for me.  

So I abonded Unity and C# for this Project and switched to __Python using pygame__ to draw lines. Now everyhting is far more simple and usable.
